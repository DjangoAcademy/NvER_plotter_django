NvERTx - A comparative embryogenesis & regeneration temporal gene expression plotter
Understanding the relationship between embryogenesis and regeneration is a long lasting question in regenerative biology as both developmental strategies lead to fully functional organisms. Modern functional genomics enables us today to re-address this question using integrative approaches that enable us to identify the similarities as well as importantly the regeneration specific elements that are potential candidates for regenerative medicine.

The starlet sea anemone Nematostella vectensis (Anthozoa, Cnidaria) is a unique model to study embryonic development and whole body regeneration in the same organism. In complement to an existing spatial gene expression database, we present here a novel tool to mine simultaneously (re)-analyzed/normalized temporal RNAseq datasets for embryonic development and oral regeneration of Nematostella vectensis. Data can be accessed by searching for your gene of interest using a gene name or the NvERTx ID of your gene of interest, scrolling trough the gene list corresponding to a given expression clusters, or by using the integrated BLAST Â® function.
